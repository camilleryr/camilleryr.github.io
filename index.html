            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome! My name is Chris Miller and I am currently a student at NSS in Cohort 22.  While this may be my first time working with code, I have myriad other life expierences that have given me the skills needed to excell in this and all my future endevours.
            </p>
            <h2>Early Life / The Musician Years</h2>
            <p>
                I was born into army brathood in 1986 on the Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, TX.  From there I was moved Iceland, Floriad and back through texas before ending up in Louisville, KY for my formative years.  Forsaking my STEM education, I shipping out to Boston in search of a music education at the Berklee College of Music with a focus in bass performance and jazz composition.
            </p>
            <p>While there I joined an Americana / Rock N Roll band that became the major force in my life for the better part of the next decade.  We travelled around the world and made a wealth of music that I still look back on fondly.  However, when the dust settled after the inevitable band break up, I was left with a less than delightful view of the mucis industy, and a yearning desire to no longer sleep on strangers floors.</p>
            <h2>Stage 2</h2>
            <p>
                The only monetizable skill I had cultivated up until this time was a basic knowledge of DIY screenprinting.  I ended up taking a role in a very small company, knowing almost none of the neccessary skills, and have grown with them over the past 5 years.  In addition to my role as student, I am also currently Production Manager and Graphic Designer of screen printing for Nashville facility servicing the countries largest Team Sports Apparel Provide.
